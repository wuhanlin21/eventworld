Q:Please detail any assumptions you have made.
1.Assume the world instance, coordinates, events, etc are generated randomly each time, and the closest events query is also called only once each time. I didn't store the world after calling the closest events function, which means you will get different results every time you create the world.
2.The ticket price range is 0-99.99
3.The format of the input is always correct. I didn't include format error check regarding input. 

Q:How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the same location?
A:I used a list of dictionaries to store all events in a specific coordinate. You can add as many events as you want after just deleting the "only one event" check statement in the code

Q:How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world size?
A:If you still want to store the world in memory, you can just simply change the size of the world in the main function. If not, I would store the location data, events data, etc in a database, and then call the function to get whatever I want.
